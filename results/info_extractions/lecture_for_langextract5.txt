[TRANSCRIPT - 00:00:00]
I think learning is like your brain. And I'm not so sure do you have the experience that you are writing the bike or riding the motorcycle or like driving a car. If that is in autopilot mode, then you will find out in sometimes section because your brain is in autopilot mode. You only pay attention to the car before you. You don't actually pay attention to what it is a street, crosswalk. You're in autopilot mode. So if we are giving you this passive learning, like I talk a lot by the way, I also talk a lot. And then you will always in this autopilot mode. So then in sometimes we will give you a break. We will try to say, stop. And then you will awake and then starting to understand things. So that is why in order for you to stay out of the autopilot mode. So if we want you to stay out of the autopilot mode, we design the courses with, but hand out are not complete. It's intentionally incomplete. So no matter how many times you say, can I have a complete handout? The answer is no. Why is an So you actually need to fill in key ideas by yourself. Something missing out, taking out then because we want you to stay out of the autopilot mode. And then in our class, we have a lot of quizzes. And those quizzes is for you to to to practice the concept as soon as we introduce those concepts to you. So this strategy are very important for this class. Non-negotiable. So no matter how many time you write in one minute reflection, we still say in that way. Okay, so this is how I think we can learn together. When I actually have certain quiz and I think that is not that good, not that interesting, or like a little bit confusing, most of the time, um, the next year, I usually will change. So if someone are interested about that, you actually can check the previous year, you will find out that my quiz usually will have some.
